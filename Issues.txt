Issues
======
- Should source path be the watch path?
- RemoteJdbcAlarmService
    - How change remote jdbc provider in running instance?
    - How protect password.
- Priority
    - @alarm - each should check the source to see if it's priority is higher than
      the current alarm?
    - Will allow multiple watches of the same node.
- How send errors in response to action invocations?
- How have multiple alarm sources monitoring a node?
- What if link crashes
  - How re-establish open alarm uuid?
    - source path be the watch, then on database open, query all open alarms
