- How handle deleted alarm classes?
    - Would be nice to show alarm class name in table.
- AlarmClass.onSteady - get open alarms and update all watches

Issues
======
- RemoteJdbcAlarmService
    - How protect password.
- Priority
    - Allow *multiple watches* on the same node.
    - @alarm - each should check the source to see if it's priority is higher than
      the current alarm?
    - in memory alarm source map that resolves priority?
